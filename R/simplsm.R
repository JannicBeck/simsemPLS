#' Simulate data on given plsm object.
#' 
#' The exogenous latent variable scores are simulated, according to 
#' the normal distribution. 
#' Coefficients for the structural and measurement model must be supplied.
#' Residuals of the structural and measurement model can be supplied.
#' If residuals are not supplied, they are simulated by rnorm with the 
#' number of observations; the default is 200.
#' The endogenous latent variable scores and manifest variables (the data) 
#' are calculated based on their linear equations.
